# The default keymap for jogpadD is as a 5x5 1u matrix.
# For all 2u positions,  the 2u is programmed as the 1u key at the top of the 2u if it is vertical, or on the left of the 2u if it is horizontal in position
# For all encoders, encoder switch press is programmed as the 1u key of that position in the matrix
